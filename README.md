# JPMC Task 3

# Description:

This task was through Forage, which works with companies to design virutal internship experiences. This specific task is one of three tasks for JPMorgan Chase. This task helped me to learn how traders use a trading dashboard for trading analysis and stock price monitoring


# Goals:

The task required me to work with JPMorgan's Perspective in order to to generate a live graph that displays a data feed. This data feed would be used by traders to monitor stock prices.

I needed to debug and adjust code so that live data would be appropriately aggregated and display the highest leverage data points in real time for users.

# Technologies used:
- Python
- React
- Perspective
